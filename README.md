# Recipe API implementation
Gets recipes by either searching with a keyword or a random one on page load

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I will not lie, I started making this way too late and I doubt its even close to the criteria of a 4 but I ran into some errors I cannot figure out for the life of me.
This is the unfinished version where I havent implemented the search with keyword functionality
React kept calling my functions repeadetly which caused issues when dealing with user inputs as methods were not asynchronous
I have turned in the task for grade 3. Only thing this project shows is that I can do that same task idependently which I doubt is nowhere close to grade 4 requirements

### `.env`
You must create .env file to project root directory with value
API=
You can use your own api key from https://spoonacular.com/food-api or use the one I have provided you before
(note you need to first create the file before installing any dependencies or it might cause issues, in case it does you can always replace the .env by just pasting the api key into the address var)

run in the project directory:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
